## Project Description
For this project, I will be making an e-commerce for gorcery store with receipes. I will begin my backend api that will be responsible for bringing in the images or gifs to the front-end. I will then utilize jQuery to make on click buttons to have totals add up.

## Time/Priority Matrix 
Include a full list of features that have been [prioritized](https://res.cloudinary.com/doaftkgbv/image/upload/v1583773146/ValueVSComplexity_u2inhx.png) based on the `Time and Priority` Matix.  This involves drawing a a square.  In the middle of the square, on the x axis draw a line.  The most left part of the line should start with 0hrs and the end of the line should include 2hrs.  This line will be used to estimate how much time any one feature will take to complete. 
Now draw a vertical line on the y axis.  The top of this line should have `High` and the bottom `Low`.  This line will be used to assign a priority to to each feature you wish to include in the project.  


### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP (examples)

- Three sections 
- Desktop menu with one catergory capable of dropdown.
- Content filters based on button
- Visually basic layout(mobile and desktop)

#### PostMVP 

- Design research
- Refactor to a visually appealing site
- Bootstrap?
- Contact page

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Hamburger | H | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
| Gridding | H | 2hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Regular Nav | H | 2hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Content placement| H | 4hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Working with APIS | H | 6hrs| -hr | -hr |
| Responsive | H | 5hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Social Media Icons | L | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
| Total | H | 25hrs| -hrs | -hrs |

#### PostMVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Gallery View | L | 6hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Research | L | 3hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Add visual complexity| M | 6hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Materialize | H | 4hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Bootstrap | H | 4hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Add form | L | 2hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Total | H | 25hrs| -hrs | -hrs |
